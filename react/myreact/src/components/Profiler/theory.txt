The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the “cost” of rendering is.
 Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application 
that are slow and may benefit from optimizations such as memoization.


function callback(id,phase,actualduration){
    console.log(id,phase,actualduration)
}

<Profiler onRender={callback}>
<components/>
</Profiler>
